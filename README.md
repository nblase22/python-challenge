# python-challenge

Completed 4 basic python challenges.

# Pybank:

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will be given two sets of revenue data (budget_data_1.csv and budget_data_2.csv). Each dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Revenue. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period

The average change in revenue between months over the entire period

The greatest increase in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

# Pypoll:

In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. (Up until now, Uncle Cleetus had been trustfully tallying them one-by-one, but unfortunately, his concentration isn't what it used to be.)

You will be given two sets of poll data (election_data_1.csv and election_data_2.csv). Each dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote.

# Pyboss:

In this challenge, you get to be the boss. You oversee hundreds of employees across the country developing Tuna 2.0, a world-changing snack food based on canned tuna fish. Alas, being the boss isn't all fun, games, and self-adulation. The company recently decided to purchase a new HR system, and unfortunately for you, the new system requires employee records be stored completely differently.

Your task is to help bridge the gap by creating a Python script able to convert your employee records to the required format. Your script will need to do the following:

Import the employee_data1.csv and employee_data2.csv files, which currently holds employee records like the below:

Emp ID,Name,DOB,SSN,State

214,Sarah Simpson,1985-12-04,282-01-8166,Florida

15,Samantha Lara,1993-09-08,848-80-7526,Colorado

411,Stacy Charles,1957-12-20,658-75-8526,Pennsylvania


Then convert and export the data to use the following format instead:

Emp ID,First Name,Last Name,DOB,SSN,State

214,Sarah,Simpson,12/04/1985,***-**-8166,FL

15,Samantha,Lara,09/08/1993,***-**-7526,CO

411,Stacy,Charles,12/20/1957,***-**-8526,PA


# PyParagraph:

In this challenge, you get to play the role of chief linguist at a local learning academy. As chief linguist, you are responsible for assessing the complexity of various passages of writing, ranging from the sophomoric Twilight novel to the nauseatingly high-minded research article. Having read so many passages, you've since come up with a fairly simple set of metrics for assessing complexity.

Your task is to create a Python script to automate the analysis of any such passage using these metrics. Your script will need to do the following:

Import a text file filled with a paragraph of your choosing.

Assess the passage for each of the following:

Approximate word count

Approximate sentence count

Approximate letter count (per word)

Average sentence length (in words)
